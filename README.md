# api-podskalska-scrapper
Converting supplementation data to data source for future uses.

## Currently supporting basic bakalari page structure
We are currently supporting parsing data from school website https://podskalska.cz. This school does not currently inform students of supplementation in every other way

### Future?
This simple script is just a scrapper for a future project. Data from this scappper will be used in mobile applications or any type of application.
The data from the database will be made public to use. Only scapper will have rights to write.

It is needed to write an API to easily call database and get data, that user want.
